The session I was asked to join concerned end-to-end encryption (“E2EE”). I was asked to “…set the scene for the discussion laying out in layman’s terms the technical possibilities of access to data and the technical consequences of it”, before being followed by the two other organizations presenting.<sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-chatham-1><a href=#fn-chatham>1</a></sup><p>I present below the remarks I made. Unusually for me, I actually wrote down all the words I intended to say in advance rather than using slides and winging it in the usual way. The context and topic felt like it would be worth avoiding slips of the tongue in this case. I gave it pretty much as written—even when I try, I can’t help a small amount of ad libbing! But I did not deviate significantly from this text.<p>Having sought feedback from others on this, I would like to add a couple of remarks as a preface.<p>First, the “Police Behaving Badly” paper puts the percentage of cybercrime convictions involving police at 56% in the first half of 2024, and details how police have had encrypted communication data but had it leaked by a corrupt intelligence analyst advising her drug dealer friend that it was compromised.<p>Second, although I did try to be clear, I could have been more explicit that a significant challenge in this space is the inevitability of software bugs. (Approximately) All software contains bugs and it is almost certain that any exceptional access system, due to the unavoidable complexity of such systems, will contain bugs and so will not work as intended. The position I am trying to take is that, while that is insufficient reason to reject every such proposal, it is important to be realistic about the risks so that the costs and benefits can be weighed rationally.<blockquote><h2 id=who-am-i><a aria-label="Anchor link for: who-am-i" class=zola-anchor href=#who-am-i>Who am I?</a></h2><p>First, I should introduce myself. I am Richard Mortier, more commonly known as Mort. I am a professor in the Department of Computer Science & Technology at Cambridge University, UK, and Fellow of Christ’s College, Cambridge. I previously spent 6 years as a researcher with Microsoft Research Cambridge, and 6 months with Sprint Advanced Technology Labs, California, and I have founded three startups. I am currently also a member of the UK’s Investigatory Powers’ Commissioner’s Office Technology Advisory Panel.<p>My primary expertise is in computer systems and networking, and human-computer interaction. I thus speak on this topic as a computer scientist with general expertise in computer systems rather than as a specialist in encryption or messaging systems. I make these remarks in a personal capacity, representing no-one’s views but my own.</blockquote><blockquote><h2 id=this-debate><a aria-label="Anchor link for: this-debate" class=zola-anchor href=#this-debate>This debate</a></h2><p>I have been asked to speak to you today about <strong>lawful</strong> or <strong>exceptional access</strong>. I will stay above the nitty-gritty technical details of encryption, communications protocols and so on, while still staying sufficiently grounded in technology that this is not a purely abstract, philosophical debate.<p>My impression of this debate is that it can often descend into an unhelpful back and forth between two extreme positions that I might simplistically characterize as “We must provide lawful access—think of the children!” and “We cannot provide lawful access—privacy is a fundamental right!”. “We must!” “We can’t!” and so on.</blockquote><blockquote><h2 id=my-position><a aria-label="Anchor link for: my-position" class=zola-anchor href=#my-position>My position</a></h2><p>I wish to re-frame this debate to place those positions at the two extremes of what is actually a spectrum of possibilities ranging from one where we have mechanisms to provide perfectly secure, invisible communication among group members where groups can form and dissolve on an ad hoc basis, to one where no communication is possible without authorized bodies having full access to all communication content and metadata.<p>Neither extreme is sensible or achievable in my view—but intermediate positions might be. The basis for a society to decide where it wants to be on that spectrum requires articulation and evaluation of the risks involved. I observe, as a computer scientist, that building any large-scale network-connected secure system is complex, and all complexity has costs and introduces risks. Typically, the more complex, the more cost and the more risk. Implementation of lawful access mechanisms is inevitably complex as they are powerful and must be secured against external and internal bad actors.<p>This needs to be acknowledged in the discussion. These are not trivial mechanisms and may even involve research activity in order to articulate the design space and understand the trade-offs involved. Justification for these mechanisms thus needs to be stronger than “we once had this ability, so we are worried about losing it”.</blockquote><blockquote><h2 id=relevant-terms><a aria-label="Anchor link for: relevant-terms" class=zola-anchor href=#relevant-terms>Relevant terms</a></h2><p>I will define some relevant terms.<p><strong>Encryption</strong> refers to the transformation of <em>plain text</em> information into a <em>cipher text</em> such that only the authorized parties can decrypt the cipher text, transforming it back into the plain text. Such transformations are usually described in mathematical terms.<p>An <strong>encryption scheme</strong> is a scheme for exchanging secret data over an insecure channel using encryption. As they are based on mathematical operations, it is generally possible to give guarantees about how computationally difficult it is to, for example, work out the plain text that produced a given cipher text—that is, to break the encryption scheme.<p>There are many such schemes with a range of trade-offs between complexity, computational cost, and how difficult they make it for an unauthorized party to decrypt a cipher text. All rely at some level on the creation and consumption of secret <strong>key material</strong> to perform transformations between plain text and cipher text.<p>In practice, an encryption scheme has to be reduced to an implementation, usually in software. It takes considerable effort to ensure that a given implementation correctly implements the encryption scheme, and even more effort to ensure that it does not leak information about the plain text message or the secret key material during encryption or (attempted) decryption.<p><strong>Secure messaging systems</strong> are Internet-connected services that provide for exchange of messages between two or more individual devices. Older systems provide message exchange by having devices send messages to central servers that then replicate those messages, transmitting them to other devices participating in the conversation. This requires those central servers to have access to the secret key material so that they can decrypt messages to work out where to send them on to.<p><strong>End-to-end encryption</strong> refers to those encryption systems where this is not the case: the central servers that assist in replication of messages to the intended recipients do not have access to the secret key material and so cannot decrypt the encrypted messages. Only the participating devices can do that. End-to-end encryption is increasingly common in consumer-grade messaging applications.<p>Finally, <strong>lawful</strong> (or <strong>exceptional</strong>) <strong>access</strong> in this context refers to technical mechanisms provided to enable authorized bodies such as law enforcement and intelligence services to access communications systems on production of suitable authorization. In the UK, for example, this would entail the relevant body seeking a suitable warrant under the Investigatory Powers Act (2016) as amended. Lawful access mechanisms have historically been provided in many communication systems.</blockquote><blockquote><h2 id=the-problem><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-problem" class=zola-anchor href=#the-problem>The problem</a></h2><p>End-to-end encryption does make provision of lawful access more difficult: the secret key material is in principle never held by the service provider and so they cannot simply grant access to messages. Mechanisms would need to be added to enable such access. But as soon as any mechanism exists for a third party to gain access to decrypted messages, bad actors will also seek to exploit it.<p>As such mechanisms are powerful, as with any additional feature they add complexity and increase the likelihood of creating vulnerabilities that can be attacked. And so the argument goes that we <strong>cannot</strong> provide lawful access mechanisms because it would be irresponsible to do so, weakening protections that law-abiding members of society rely upon for so many different purposes.<p>But, so the counter-argument continues, lawful access is necessary to protect the public including the vulnerable and children. Bad actors make use of secure messaging services to exchange illegal material, to plan and execute serious crimes, to commit terrorism and so forth. So mechanisms for lawful access <strong>must</strong> be provided otherwise it is impossible for law enforcement to carry out their duties to enforce the law and protect society. And so the argument continues that we must provide mechanisms for lawful access.<p>We can’t. We must. We can’t. We must. Both positions are extreme points in a spectrum of risk. What I believe we can and must do is take a risk-based approach to this challenge: articulate the risks and, if we decide they are worth taking, develop mechanisms to mitigate them. Lawful access can be done and has been done—but should it be done, and how?</blockquote><blockquote><h2 id=two-principles><a aria-label="Anchor link for: two-principles" class=zola-anchor href=#two-principles>Two principles</a></h2><p>So what are the principles to consider, what risks do such mechanisms create, and how might we consider them?<p>The first principle is that any lawful access mechanism is, by definition, powerful. It allows an authorized party to access information that people wish to keep secret. It is not therefore something that is easy to design, implement, test, maintain and operate: considerable care will be required, and potentially considerable expense incurred.<p>The second is that any such mechanism can and will be abused. Bad actors will seek to exploit it to gain access to information, and may well succeed from time to time. Those unauthorized accesses will come from external bad actors but also internal bad actors. As well as the maintenance costs this creates, it also suggests that accountability and transparency are critical.<p>For example, the <a href=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ah793/cccd.html rel=external>Cambridge Computer Crime Database</a> is a database of cybercrime events of many kinds where the offender or alleged offender has been arrested, charged and/or prosecuted in the UK, dating from 1 January 2010. In the last 6 months of 2023, nearly half of the cases involved police as offenders. I am not saying that these directly involve lawful access or similar mechanisms, or that such incidents are commonplace—but it is undeniable that they do occur, and that lawful access mechanisms could create another route by which they can be carried out. Bad actors will also be present in the service providers. Strong powers require strong oversight.<p>The debate cannot continue under the assumptions that this is a straightforward technology to build and protect against unauthorized use, and that authorized users will always use it lawfully.</blockquote><blockquote><h2 id=thinking-about-risk-necessity-proportionality><a aria-label="Anchor link for: thinking-about-risk-necessity-proportionality" class=zola-anchor href=#thinking-about-risk-necessity-proportionality>Thinking about risk: necessity & proportionality</a></h2><p>I think it is useful to think about the risks from a perspective of necessity and proportionality.<p>First, <strong>necessity</strong>: what is it that lawful access enables, and why? Mechanisms could be built to enable a range of types of lawful access. For example, access to the content of all messages; access to the content of all messages involving certain keywords or with attached images that trigger some flag; access to the content of all messages involving certain participants; access to the content of selected messages; or access to metadata about messages such as participant identifiers, message timestamps, locations of transmission and reception, whether for all messages, all messages involving certain parties, or specific messages. To determine what access is appropriate requires articulating the purpose: to what use will the information be put? By whom? And are there really no existing mechanisms by which the desired outcome can be achieved?<p>Second, <strong>proportionality</strong>: what are the effects of exercising lawful access, and how are the harms to be balanced against the benefits? All the mechanisms listed above create risks when abused—but some create more risks than others. Creating an ability, however well protected, to read any and all messages between any communicating parties clearly creates enormous potential for privacy infringement and crime. Creating an ability simply to know which accounts communicated and when also creates risks but perhaps lesser ones in most cases.<p>These perspectives need to be tested and debated before suitable mechanisms can be designed, implemented, and exercised. Oversight mechanisms—perhaps including by non-governmental organizations—need to be part of the design. The intended benefits need to be articulated. Usage and impact need to be tracked. Scope creep and the ability to silently expand the reach of such a capability to enable mass surveillance needs to be guarded against. Comparison needs to be made against alternative current approaches. For example, a warrant can be obtained to hack a target’s phone giving access to all content on that device, not just their messages; is that more or less intrusive than providing a mechanism that enables selected messages or communications’ metadata to be obtained on presentation of a suitable warrant, but which simply cannot be used to reveal any other content?<p>In a world where, as I understand it, policing resources are constantly being stretched, how will law enforcement ensure it has the capacity to use effectively information gained via such lawful access mechanisms? The risks created by these mechanisms, once deployed, are always present even when they are not being legally exercised: creating the mechanisms and then not effectively using them considerably reduces any proportionality argument. If the resource to sift existing data is already stretched, how will putting more hay on the haystack help in finding the needles?<p>For example, the success of operations against systems such as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EncroChat rel=external>Encrochat</a> and <a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyljpygxgjo rel=external>Ghost</a> raises the question: is it enough to concentrate on those systems that target criminal use? How much extra will be gained by creating lawful access mechanisms in consumer-grade systems? I am not saying nothing will be gained—but the expected benefits need to be quantified for the case to be made.<p>Is the call for lawful access mechanisms based on specific, recorded instances where they would have made a material difference to society? Or is it based primarily on fear of a future where once useful mechanisms cease to be available? “Once we could but now we cannot” is not a very strong argument for necessity and proportionality given the way that technology has constantly evolved over decades and centuries.<p>The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act rel=external>Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) 1994</a> enforced US communications providers to implement wire-tapping capabilities. It also mandated that those providers secure their networks. Unfortunately, it seems that the implementation of <a href=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/04/arguing-against-calea.html rel=external>that capability created a risk that was exploited</a> by a group dubbed <a href=https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/07/the-30-year-old-internet-backdoor-law-that-came-back-to-bite/ rel=external>Salt Typhoon</a> to allow capture of sensitive call metadata in Washington D.C. Experts have been reported as saying that such an attack was “inevitable”. How can such risks, in terms of both likelihood and impact, be quantified and weighed in the balance?</blockquote><blockquote><h2 id=non-solutions><a aria-label="Anchor link for: non-solutions" class=zola-anchor href=#non-solutions>Non-solutions</a></h2><p>It is worth at this point dismissing some ways that have in the past been proposed for lawful access but which have very significant problems.<p>First, deliberately weakening encryption schemes. This simply does not work in practice: bad actors will use more secure schemes anyway, and will seek to exploit law-abiding services that use the weakened schemes, putting law-abiding users at risk.<p>Second, forms of key escrow. This is where the secret key material is placed under the control of some trusted party, and can be accessed on presentation of a suitably authorized request. Unfortunately, this allows anyone who can produce, whether or not legitimately, such a request to access <strong>all</strong> communications.<p>Third, ghost users. This is where providers add law enforcement operatives to chats without triggering notifications or otherwise informing chat participants that a new member has been added. While in some ways technically attractive, as described such a mechanism provides no means for accountability and oversight: what record is made, and how is it inspected, that such an action was carried out by the service provider, for what purpose, at what time.</blockquote><blockquote><h2 id=a-possible-solution><a aria-label="Anchor link for: a-possible-solution" class=zola-anchor href=#a-possible-solution>A possible solution</a></h2><p>I will close by sketching <a href=https://martin.kleppmann.com/2021/07/16/cryptographic-backdoors-hotpets.html rel=external>a proposal from a colleague, Dr Martin Kleppmann</a>, for a lawful access mechanism that seeks to balance benefits and harms, published at the <a href=https://petsymposium.org/2021/hotpets.php rel=external>HotPETS (Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium) Workshop in 2021</a>. It seeks to ensure that undetectable mass surveillance cannot be carried out, and that oversight can be exercised in relevant jurisdictions.<p>In short, it provides a public <em>transparency log</em> into which all accepted lawful access requests are written with a few publicly readable fields indicating the requesting body, the warrant jurisdiction, its basis and validity period, plus some cryptographic commitment as to the target for the warrant. Thus, anyone can see how many warrants are being issued, why, and when <em>without the targets being revealed</em>.<p>The service’s client application then checks the log and if it finds a valid entry for the device it is running on, it uploads the requested data for the indicated period to the specified LEA. This is similar to the message backup procedure already provided for by many secure messaging applications.<p>At the same time, a trusted oversight body in the jurisdiction can cross-check log entries against issued warrants, and require the service provider to reveal the targets of those warrants so that proportionality can be justified by reference to the seriousness of the crime of which they are accused.<p>This provides targeted upload of data, reducing the ease with which bad actors can use it to acquire data themselves. It enables interested parties, perhaps including civil society organizations, to monitor general use of the mechanism so that moves towards mass surveillance can be detected. It enables trusted oversight bodies to exercise powers to inspect and ensure that necessity and proportionality requirements are being met.<p>This is not a fully worked up proposal, and it does not thoroughly address every possible challenge. To produce such a proposal would require, as well as some of the discussion and debate referred to above, more technical details about how the communications services that would be subject to such mechanisms are architected and operated. But it hopefully serves as an example of an approach that sits on the spectrum somewhere between “We can’t” and “We must”.</blockquote><blockquote><h2 id=conclusions><a aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusions" class=zola-anchor href=#conclusions>Conclusions</a></h2><p>In summary then,<ul><li>I believe that it is in principle possible to design, implement and deploy lawful access mechanisms, even in end-to-end encrypted systems.<li>But doing so requires careful justification as to necessity and proportionality: just because such mechanisms could be built and would be useful does not automatically mean that they should be built.<li>Such justification must include realistic consideration of the risks even just the existence of such mechanisms would introduce, as well as mechanisms to mitigate those risks.<li>To maintain public trust in secure communications means that such strong powers must be designed and implemented so as to enable strong oversight by trusted bodies, likely including non-governmental bodies.</ul></blockquote><hr><blockquote><h2 id=references><a aria-label="Anchor link for: references" class=zola-anchor href=#references>References</a></h2><ul><li><p>“<a href=https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/principles-more-informed-exceptional-access-debate rel=external>Principles for a More Informed Exceptional Access Debate</a>”, Ian Levy & Crispin Robinson. 29 November 2018.</p><li><p>“<a href=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ah793/papers/2019inside_out.pdf rel=external>Inside out: Characterising cybercrimes committed inside and outside the workplace</a>”.
