Also obtaining a <a href=http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/content/dr-richard-mortier rel=external>College Fellowship</a> and experiencing a <a href=https://blog.docker.com/2016/01/unikernel/ rel=external>Company Acquisition</a> were considerable (interesting, welcome) distractions… :)<p>As an interim measure, and because I’ve been asked relatively frequently over the last few months, I thought I’d collect some local knowledge^Wopinion, garnered over many long hard years of hanging about in both Cambridge and Nottingham. What follows should be viewed as indicating nothing more than my lack of imagination.<p>Both Cambridge and Nottingham are blessed with many fine pubs, as well as several truly terrible ones. Less said about the latter the better. But among those that I like, and will occasionally drag various people to (including the <a href=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/ rel=external>SRG</a>) are, arranged roughly in geographical order from the Computer Lab to the Station:<ul><li><a href=http://www.theploughcoton.co.uk/ rel=external>The Plough, Coton</a>. Gastro-pub-ish. Frequently changed management over recent years, but currently seems pretty consistent and (finally!) is not limited to Greene King beers.<li><a href=http://thecastleinncambridge.com/ rel=external>The Castle Inn</a>. Major long-standing Adnams “proper pub”. Very consistent. Castle Burger and chips please.<li><a href=http://www.taylor-walker.co.uk/pub/pickerel-cambridge/c3602/ rel=external>The Pickerel</a>. Also largely unchanged in a couple of decades. Good for a pint before entering the Greene King desert.<li><a href=https://whatpub.com/pubs/CAM/184/st-radegund-cambridge rel=external>The Radegund</a>. Tiniest pub I know of. Recently quite radically refurbished. But, while not what it was, seems pretty decent nonetheless.<li><a href=https://whatpub.com/pubs/CAM/79/free-press-cambridge rel=external>The Free Press</a>. Has improved significantly while I was in Nottingham. Very good food and beer. Stocks the only actually pleasant Greene King beer (<a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/greene-king-xx-mild/14879/ rel=external>XX Mild</a>), as well as an interesting range of others. Quite small and often packed if it’s too cold to sit outside.<li><a href=http://www.the-cambridgeblue.co.uk/ rel=external>The Cambridge Blue</a>. Surely one of the best pubs for many many miles. Excellent and huge range of beer (and, apparently, cider; won’t touch the stuff myself). Good food. Large and with a large garden too – rarely a problem finding somewhere to sit during the week.<li><a href=http://www.kingston-arms.co.uk/ rel=external>The Kingston Arms</a>. Another excellent pub in the station area. Possibly better food than the Blue, potentially slightly less wide ranging set of beers (and, certainly, ciders). Also a nice garden, though in all respects somewhat smaller than the Blue so prone to being absolutely packed. Doesn’t serve lager – a certain German colleague makes do with JHB though.<li><a href=https://whatpub.com/pubs/CAM/118/live-let-live-cambridge rel=external>The Live and Let Live</a>. Yet one more excellent and, though small, often less busy pub near the station. No food in the evenings.<li><a href=https://www.individualpubs.co.uk/devonshire/ rel=external>The Devonshire Arms</a>. Largest range of Milton Brewery beers I know of. Food = pizzas I believe (though not, last time I tried, as good as those at <a href=http://www.carpentersarmscambridge.co.uk/ rel=external>The Carpenters Arms</a>).</ul><p>I don’t get out to the villages as often as I’d like now, but <a href=http://www.thegreenmangrantchester.co.uk/#the-green-man-grantchester rel=external>The Green Man, Grantchester</a>, <a href=http://www.bluelionhardwick.co.uk/ rel=external>The Blue Lion, Hardwick</a> and especially <a href=http://theredlionhiston.co.uk/ rel=external>The Red Lion, Histon</a> are (or were last time I went) all excellent too. The latter is still possibly my favourite pub anywhere in fact.<p>I only spent a few years in Nottingham, and it’s a Proper City unlike Cambridge, so I can’t claim to have tested it thoroughly. However, places I did visit fairly regularly in Nottingham, Beeston, and Wollaton that I certainly enjoyed include:<ul><li><a href=http://www.theroundhousenottingham.co.uk/ rel=external>The Roundhouse</a>. A little pricey for Nottingham, but good quality beer and food, nice atmosphere.<li><a href=http://www.castlerockbrewery.co.uk/pubs/lincolnshire-poacher/ rel=external>The Lincolnshire Poacher</a>. Very excellent pub. Good whisky range too.<li><a href=http://www.fellowsmortonandclayton.co.uk/ rel=external>Fellows, Morton & Clayton</a>. Consistently good, proper pub food, about 4 minutes walk from the station platforms.<li><a href=http://www.castlerockbrewery.co.uk/pubs/vat-and-fiddle/ rel=external>The Vat & Fiddle</a>. Only finally tried more recently. Castle Rock brewery tap. Good food and beer, also about 4 minutes walk from your station platform.<li><a href=http://www.thehandandheart.co.uk/ rel=external>The Hand & Heart</a>. In a cave! It’s a pub in a cave! With excellent beer and good food! And not owned by Greene King! (Unlike <a href=http://triptojerusalem.com/ rel=external>Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem</a> which has bigger, better caves but markedly less good beer or food.)<li><a href=http://www.bluemonkeybrewery.com/pubs/organ-grinder-nottingham rel=external>The Organ Grinder</a>. Another fine pub at Canning Circus. Blue Monkey brewery this time – rather good. Food limited to (nice!) pork pies and such, but the beer is good.<li><a href=http://www.nottinghambrewery.co.uk/the_plough_inn.html rel=external>The Plough Inn</a>. Closest (decent) pub to Jubilee Campus. Nottingham City brewery tap. Excellent beer, no food in the evenings, and prices that make me think I’m 15 years younger…<li><a href=http://www.victoriabeeston.co.uk/ rel=external>The Victoria Hotel, Beeston</a>. Consistently excellent pub. Excellent beer, very good food.<li><a href=http://www.everards.co.uk/our-pubs/crown-inn-beeston/ rel=external>The Crown Inn, Beeston</a>. Also consistently excellent beer, though no food in the evenings.<li><a href=http://www.molefacepubcompany.co.uk/the-wollaton-pub-and-kitchen.html rel=external>The Wollaton Pub and Kitchen, Wollaton</a>. Gastro-pub-ish. Generally good beer, often excellent but occasionally patchy food.</ul><p>So there you go. Some opinions if relatively little knowledge. YMMV. Etc.<p>(PS. If I know you, I’ll also be happy to give recommendations of solicitors, builders and other house-associated professionals too. And a couple of warnings.)<nav><div><a href=https://mort.io/blog/grubbing-around/>‹ Grubbing Around</a></div><div><a href=https://mort.io/blog/elcapitan-maps/> Of Mice and Keyboards ›</a></div></nav></article></main><footer><hr><div class=c><nav class=tpad><div><a title="mort’s mythopœia Atom Feed" href=https://mort.io/atom.xml target=_blank type=application/atom+xml><i class="svg rss" title="mort’s mythopœia Atom Feed" type=Button></i></a><a title="mort’s mythopœia RSS Feed" href=https://mort.io/rss.xml target=_blank type=application/rss+xml><i class="svg rss" title="mort’s mythopœia RSS Feed" type=Button></i></a><a href=mailto:richard.mortier@cl.cam.ac.uk target=_blank title=Mail><i class="svg mail" title=Mail type=Button></i></a><a href=https://mastodon.me.uk/@mort rel=me target=_blank title=Mastodon><i class="svg mastodon" title=Mastodon type=Button></i></a><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-mortier/ target=_blank title=LinkedIn><i class="svg linkedin" title=LinkedIn type=Button></i></a><a href=https://github.com/mor1/ target=_blank title=Github><i class="svg github" title=Github type=Button></i></a><a href=https://hub.docker.com/u/mor1/ target=_blank title=Docker><i class="svg docker" title=Docker type=Button></i></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkRF0fgqvvMx5Owh1QgilmExGQe58go_u" target=_blank title=YouTube><i class="svg youtube" title=YouTube type=Button></i></a></div></nav><nav class=vpad><a class=rpad href=https://mort.io/sitemap.xml target=_blank> sitemap </a><a class=rpad href=https://mort.io/tags/> tags </a></nav><p class=s90>mort’s mythopœia © 2013—<span id=year>2026</span> Richard Mortier</div></footer><span class=topout> <span class=topleft> </span><a title="Back to Top" class=top href=#><i class="svgs svgh angu"></i></a> </span>
