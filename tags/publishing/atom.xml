        <content type="html" xml:base="https://mort.io/blog/happy-day/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;2025.eurosys.org&#x2F;index.html&quot;&gt;EuroSys 2025&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was co-located with &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asplos-conference.org&#x2F;asplos2025&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ASPLOS
2025&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; this year. Other
commitments meant I (again) couldn’t stay for the whole conference, attending
primarily because &lt;a href=&quot;..&#x2F;tdis-accepted&#x2F;&quot;&gt;two students had papers in the TDIS
workshop&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;stage.jpg&quot; class=&quot;fl pd1&quot; alt=&quot;A photograph of me in a yellow t-shirt receiving the award&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But happily I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; able to stay for the first day of the conference –
“happily” not only because it gave me a chance to catch up with some old friends
I hadn’t seen in a decade or more, but also because &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;2451116.2451167&quot;&gt;the Mirage unikernels
paper&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which appeared at &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;asplos13.rice.edu&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ASPLOS
2013&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; won one of two &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asplos-conference.org&#x2F;asplos2025&#x2F;awards&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ASPLOS 2025 Influential Papers
awards&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is obviously very flattering – typically doing research is necessarily its
own reward because the work can seem fruitless much of the time. Even when a
paper gets written and submitted it will most likely be rejected – I think
EuroSys this year reported something like a 12% acceptance rate, so rejection is
&lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the most likely outcome. Finally, if the paper does finally get
accepted, it will most likely sink without trace – perhaps a brief flurry of
interest for a few months or so, the paper gets cited a few times, and then it
fades away. This seems inevitable in a reasonably fast moving field that is also
growing at pace – EuroSys had ~160 attendees in 2006, growing to ~330 in the 10
years to 2016, but hitting ~1100 this year; while submissions grew from ~200 in
2019 to 696 this year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;official.jpg&quot; class=&quot;fr pd1&quot; alt=&quot;A photograph of the certificate&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to win an award recognising that others feel a paper actually had some
influence is rare, and makes me very happy :) At the same time, it reinforces a
couple of lessons that I really should’ve internalised by now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is that papers inevitably get better for thoughtful considered
feedback from experts a step or several away from the work – so drafts should
be produced in plenty of time and distributed to anyone who’s willing to take
the time for feedback. In the case of this paper the previous failed submission
to &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;conference&#x2F;osdi12&quot;&gt;OSDI 2012&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; had, let’s say, reviews
of mixed quality. But one stood out, from Jon Howell (who signs his reviews so I
know it was him), who gave us a firm “reject” which (in retrospect) was actually
fairly well-deserved but in an incredibly constructive way. To paraphrase him
slightly, the work was interesting but the paper was crap – &lt;em&gt;and here’s how to
rewrite it so it makes sense&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. We basically did what he said, ASPLOS accepted
it, and the rest is now history. (Over a decade ago, good grief.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is that I simply cannot predict whether any research I’m doing is
actually going to turn out to have any value. The only other equivalent award
I’ve had was an &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;infocom2024.ieee-infocom.org&#x2F;awards&quot;&gt;INFOCOM 2024 Test of Time
award&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1109&#x2F;INFCOM.2012.6195845&quot;&gt;our 2012 paper on a
system called &lt;em&gt;Thinkair&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, about
mobile-code offload from devices to the cloud. That paper had received
considerably more than just one rejection prior to acceptance, and if I recall
my final contribution correctly, I recommended not submitting it to INFOCOM as I
didn’t think we’d done enough to address previous review comments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shows what I know. But then, how boring would life be without a little
ignorance… :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://mort.io/blog/tdis-accepted/">&lt;p&gt;As I find myself once more on a train to parts unknown (to me at least), a brief
update :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parts unknown in question is Rotterdam, NL (so really quite well-known to
quite a lot of people, just not me) for &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;2025.eurosys.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;EURO&#x2F;SYS
2025&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (being held jointly with &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asplos-conference.org&#x2F;asplos2025&quot;&gt;ASPLOS
2025&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, although I can’t stay for
the whole thing unfortunately) and specifically the &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tdis.gitlab.io&#x2F;tdis25&#x2F;&quot;&gt;3rd International Workshop
of Testing Distributed Internet of Things Systems
(TDIS)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Happily the programme committee decided to accept two papers from my
(ex-)students – which is nice :) The two in question are&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3719159.3721222&quot;&gt;Reckon-ing Kubernetes at the Edge using Emulated
Clusters&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; with Alessandro Sassi
(University of Cambridge &#x2F; Politecnico di Milano) and Christopher Jensen
(University of Cambridge &#x2F; Microsoft Research). This describes Alessandro’s
M.Sc. research project undertaken as a visitor with my group. He built on
Chris’ earlier work on &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3447851.3458739&quot;&gt;Reckon, an emulator setup for examining consensus
system behaviour&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Alessandor
extended this to use ContainerNet enabling it to emulate Kubernetes clusters
on a single node, and used this to examine Kubernetes performance in some
edge network scenarios. Source available on GitHub at
&lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AleSassi&#x2F;reckon-k8s&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AleSassi&#x2F;reckon-k8s&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3719159.3721221&quot;&gt;LoRaLive: Efficient LoRaWAN Traffic
Generation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; with Vadim Safronov
(University of Oxford &#x2F; University of Cambridge). This reports a component of
Vadim’s Ph.D. work where he built a system to enable dense deployment LoRaWAN
trace-playback using a minimal number of nodes while respecting legal
constraints on duty cycles. Source available on GitHub at
&lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LoRaLive&#x2F;LoRaLive&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LoRaLive&#x2F;LoRaLive&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both nice tools that we hope might be of community interest!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ph.D. in question is Chris Jensen’s – happily he passed his viva on
Thursday just gone, titled “Separating conflict-recovery from failure-recovery
in distributed consensus”, examined by &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timharris.uk&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Tim Harris&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and
&lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;charap.co&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Aleksey Charapko&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Other recent passes include Al-Amjad
Tawfiq Isstaif, titled “Contention-resilient overcommitment for serverless
deployments” and Andrew Jeffery, titled “Modelling orchestration”. The race&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot; id=&quot;fr-1-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-1&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
is now on for the first to &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cl.cam.ac.uk&#x2F;techreports&#x2F;&quot;&gt;tech
report&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not really a race. That would be weird. &lt;a href=&quot;#fr-1-1&quot;&gt;↩&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://mort.io/blog/post-covid-tpc/">&lt;p&gt;I do not participate in a huge number of TPCs (Technical Programme Committees)
as a general rule– partly time constraints but mostly no-one knows who I am so
I don’t often get asked… (!)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have done a few though, some big (e.g., &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;conference&#x2F;nsdi15&quot;&gt;USENIX NSDI&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;conferences.sigcomm.org&#x2F;imc&#x2F;2018&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ACM IMC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;),
some small (&lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uksystems.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;UK Systems&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
&lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;conference&#x2F;pam&quot;&gt;PAM&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), and perhaps because I only do
a couple every few years, while doing &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;conferences2.sigcomm.org&#x2F;co-next&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ACM
CoNEXT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acm-ieee-sec.org&#x2F;list&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ACM&#x2F;IEEE
SEC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; this week, I found myself particularly
noticing some changes in practice since that last TPCs I recall (notably
&lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;conference&#x2F;nsdi15&quot;&gt;NSDI&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;conferences.sigcomm.org&#x2F;imc&#x2F;2018&#x2F;&quot;&gt;IMC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). So here are three observations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-online-first-and-only&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#1-online-first-and-only&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 1-online-first-and-only&quot;&gt;1. Online, first and only&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest obvious change is that TPC meetings are now online rather than
in-person. This has one big disadvantage for me: I really enjoyed travelling to
the meeting to meet colleagues and (usually) participate in some TPC-oriented
workshop with presentations of recent an in-progress work. In many ways, I found
this sort of activity more interesting than the conference itself (sorry!). It
also has the unfortunate effect that, at least for international TPCs, timezones
make scheduling tricky – one benefit of travelling was that at least the
meeting took place in localtime for (almost) everyone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it also has clear benefits: the CO2 footprint of the event is
dramatically reduced which can only be a good thing. The financial cost
reduction probably also opens up the experience to attendees who would never
previously have been able to make it. I’ve rarely seen really poor meeting
behaviour on the TPCs I’ve been involved in, but I also find that in an online
meeting, chairing tends to be more easily more rigorous and the sometimes
dominating effect of a single confident (perhaps I might say over-confident, or
even just loud) individual is significantly reduced. Which is good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-offline-dominance&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#2-offline-dominance&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 2-offline-dominance&quot;&gt;2. Offline dominance&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now see &lt;strong&gt;dramatically&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; more use being made of commenting and discussions in
&lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;read.seas.harvard.edu&#x2F;~kohler&#x2F;hotcrp&#x2F;&quot;&gt;HotCRP&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which remains the only
conference management and paper reviewing platform I will willingly use (thanks
&lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eddie_Kohler&quot;&gt;Eddie&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;!). I don’t know whether this
is a post-pandemic effect, or just the fact that the old old guard has largely
shuffled out of active TPC duties and we now have a new old guard (ie., people
of my era) and younger who are perhaps happier to communicate and express views
without needing to be in the same room.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is another dramatic improvement in process, and puts us in a
similar place to how, for example, we handled marking final year undergraduate
projects at &lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nottingham.ac.uk&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Nottingham University&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It means
that discussion is recorded, and usually more coherently and explicitly argued
due to the need to write it down.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-reduction-in-extremism&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#3-reduction-in-extremism&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 3-reduction-in-extremism&quot;&gt;3. Reduction in extremism&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one arguably slightly negative comment I would have is – and this is only
my anecdotal impression, and not something I can pretend to have data on – that
I think I see a tendency for reviewers to perhaps be a little less clear in
their scoring. Once the across the board strong rejects (a fair number) and
strong accepts (a much smaller number) were taken out, I saw an awful lot of
weak reject (but happy to consider weak accept after discussion) and weak accept
(but happy to consider weak reject after discussion). This made it quite hard
for me, as another reviewer, sometimes to get a clear signal as to what the
other reviews were recommending.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a challenge I sometimes see in admissions interviewing: less experienced
interviewers are sometimes  reluctant to give a clear signal, exhibiting instead
a tendency to score near or perhaps just above the middle of the scale. (I
remember doing this myself.) This feels more comfortable – putting one’s head
above the parapet by taking a clear stance often feels more socially awkward
than giving a “fine, ok, pretty good, sure” response, not least because it needs
stronger supporting argument – but in the end I think it misses the point of
being an interviewer &#x2F; a TPC member which is exactly to accept or reject papers
based on having been recognised for your expertise.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the end, two good points, two potential (but minor) negatives, and one
completely unjustifiable and purely selfish negative. Which on the whole is a
good thing. Though having come back to this after a break for a couple of years,
I find I am even more sceptical of the whole process than I was. More later
perhaps, once I get my thoughts in order.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
